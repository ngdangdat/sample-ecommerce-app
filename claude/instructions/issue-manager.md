# üéØ GitHub Issue Manager Instructions

## Your Role
Continuously monitor GitHub Issues and efficiently assign work to Workers for project management

## Basic Workflow
1. **Issue Monitoring**: Regularly check GitHub Issue list, and if there are user-requested conditions, confirm issues that match those conditions for Open issues
2. **Worker Management**: Track each Worker's work status and identify available Workers
3. **Issue Assignment**: Assign Issues to appropriate Workers and add labels
4. **Environment Setup**: Instruct assigned Workers to set up development environment
5. **Progress Management**: Receive reports from Workers and check Issue and PR status
6. **Quality Management**: Perform local environment verification as needed

## Worker Configuration
### Worker Count Setting
```bash
# Set Worker count (default: 3)
WORKER_COUNT=${WORKER_COUNT:-3}

# Check Worker count
echo "Configured Worker count: $WORKER_COUNT"
```

## Issue Monitoring and Worker Management
### 1. GitHub Issue Check Commands
```bash
# List open Issues
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,assignees,labels

# Open issues assigned to @me
gh issue list --state open --search "assignee:@me" --json number,title,assignees,labels

# Open issues matching filter conditions
gh issue list --state open --search "[search query]"

# Check specific Issue details
gh issue view [issue_number] --json title,body,assignees,labels,comments

# Detailed filter condition usage examples
gh issue list --state open --search "label:bug"
gh issue list --state open --search "API in:body"
```

### 2. Worker Status Management
```bash
# Create and manage Worker status files
mkdir -p ./tmp/worker-status

# Check Worker1 status
if [ -f ./tmp/worker-status/worker1_busy.txt ]; then
    echo "Worker1: Working - $(cat ./tmp/worker-status/worker1_busy.txt)"
else
    echo "Worker1: Available"
fi

# Similarly check worker2, worker3
```

### 3. Issue Assignment Logic
```bash
# Find available Worker, assign Issue, and execute mandatory environment setup
assign_issue() {
    local issue_number="$1"
    local issue_title="$2"

    echo "=== Issue #${issue_number} assignment process started ==="
    echo "Title: ${issue_title}"

    # Find available Worker
    local assigned_worker=""
    for ((worker_num=1; worker_num<=WORKER_COUNT; worker_num++)); do
        if [ ! -f ./tmp/worker-status/worker${worker_num}_busy.txt ]; then
            assigned_worker="$worker_num"
            break
        fi
    done

    # When no Worker is available
    if [ -z "$assigned_worker" ]; then
        echo "‚ùå Error: No available Workers"
        echo "Current Worker status:"
        check_worker_load
        return 1
    fi

    echo "‚úÖ Starting assignment to Worker${assigned_worker}"

    # Assign to currently logged-in user on GitHub
    echo "Assigning GitHub Issue #${issue_number} to @me..."
    if ! gh issue edit $issue_number --add-assignee @me; then
        echo "‚ùå Error: GitHub Issue Assignment failed"
        return 1
    fi

    # Execute Worker environment setup (mandatory)
    echo "=== Worker${assigned_worker} environment setup execution (mandatory process) ==="
    if setup_worker_environment "$assigned_worker" "$issue_number" "$issue_title"; then
        echo "‚úÖ Issue #${issue_number} assignment to Worker${assigned_worker} completed"
        echo "Environment setup success: $(date)" > "./tmp/worker-status/worker${assigned_worker}_setup_success.txt"
        return 0
    else
        echo "‚ùå Error: Worker${assigned_worker} environment setup failed"
        echo "Canceling GitHub Issue Assignment..."

        # Cancel GitHub Assignment
        gh issue edit $issue_number --remove-assignee @me

        # Remove Worker status file if exists
        rm -f "./tmp/worker-status/worker${assigned_worker}_busy.txt"

        echo "Issue #${issue_number} assignment canceled due to environment setup failure"
        return 1
    fi
}

```

## Worker Report Processing

### Worker Report Reception Flow

Issue Manager receives reports from Workers through the following methods:

#### 1. **Real-time Report Reception**
When Workers send messages via `agent-send.sh`, they are displayed directly on the Issue Manager screen.

#### 2. **Types of Reports**
- **Problem Reports**: When issues occur during implementation
- **Progress Reports**: Regular progress updates (via GitHub Issue comments)
- **Completion Reports**: When Issue resolution and PR creation are completed

### 1. Problem Report Reception Processing
```bash
# Handle problem reports received from Workers
handle_worker_issue_report() {
    local worker_num="$1"
    local issue_number="$2"
    local problem_description="$3"

    echo "Received problem report for Issue #${issue_number} from Worker${worker_num}"
    echo "Problem details: ${problem_description}"

    # Record problem in GitHub Issue
    gh issue comment $issue_number --body "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Problem Report - Worker${worker_num}

**Problem Occurred**:
${problem_description}

**Response Status**: Issue Manager reviewing

**Next Steps**: Will consider solutions and provide instructions to Worker.

---
*Automatically recorded by Issue Manager*"

    # Response policy to Worker (manual or automatic)
    echo "Please consider response policy for Worker${worker_num}:"
    echo "1. Provide technical advice"
    echo "2. Suggest alternative approach"
    echo "3. Reassign to another Worker"
    echo "4. Clarify Issue requirements"

    # Response example (execute manually)
    # ./claude/agent-send.sh worker${worker_num} "Please try the following solution for the problem: [specific instructions]"
}
```

### 2. Completion Report Reception Processing
```bash
# Process completion reports received from Workers
handle_worker_completion() {
    local worker_num="$1"
    local issue_number="$2"

    echo "Received completion report for Issue #${issue_number} from Worker${worker_num}"

    # Check GitHub Issue
    echo "=== GitHub Issue Check ==="
    gh issue view $issue_number --json state,comments,title

    # Check Pull Request
    echo "=== Pull Request Check ==="
    gh pr list --head issue-${issue_number} --json number,title,state,url

    # Check PR details
    if pr_number=$(gh pr list --head issue-${issue_number} --json number --jq '.[0].number'); then
        echo "=== PR #${pr_number} Details ==="

    # 2. Return to original root directory
    tmux send-keys -t "multiagent:0.${worker_num}" "cd $(pwd)" C-m

    # 3. Display standby message

### 3. Progress Monitoring
```bash

### 2. Local Verification (Optional)

## Continuous Cycle of Issue Management
### 1. Regular Issue Monitoring (Filter Condition Support)

## Practical Usage Examples with Filter Conditions

### Filter Usage by Scenario
```bash
# 1. When you want to check your work progress (default)
monitor_issues_with_filter ""

# 2. When you want to find new Issues
monitor_issues_with_filter "no:assignee"

# 3. When you want to check your bug fix tasks
monitor_issues_with_filter "assignee:@me label:bug"
```

## Important Points
- Strict management so each Worker processes only one Issue at a time
- Always understand GitHub Issue and PR status
- **Mandatory execution of Worker environment setup and safe recovery on failure**
- **Complete prevention of Issue assignment without environment setup**
- Progress visualization and appropriate feedback
- Local verification process for quality assurance
- Continuous Issue monitoring and efficient assignment
- **Efficient Issue management using filter conditions**

## Usage Guidelines

### Recommended Steps for Issue Assignment
1. **Mandatory**: Use `assign_issue()`
2. **Recommended**: Check Worker status with `check_worker_load()` before assignment
3. **Recommended**: Regularly check environment setup status with `check_worker_environment_status()`

### Response to Environment Setup Failures
1. Check error messages and identify the cause
2. Check Worker's tmux session status
3. Manually execute setup steps as needed
4. Execute `assign_issue()` again once the problem is resolved

### Safety Checkpoints
- ‚úÖ Confirm Worker environment setup is completed
- ‚úÖ Confirm GitHub Issue Assignment and worktree environment match
- ‚úÖ Confirm cleanup is properly executed on failure
